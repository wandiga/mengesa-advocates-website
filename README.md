<h1>Mengesa Advocates Website</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Practice Project Number: </strong>1</p>
<p><strong>Time taken: </strong>1 week</p>
<p><strong>Year: </strong>2022</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>I was tasked to design this website in 2021, although someone else developed it.</p>
<br>
<p>After starting to learn HTML + CSS this year, I gave myself a timeline of 1 week max. to rebuild this site as best as I can and would stop after a week. I did this to allow me to gauge where I was, in terms of speed vs. quality.</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>Due to the tight timeline I set, and the fact that I was still learning concepts as I go, these are some of the issues with the site:</p>
<li>Could not add the menu bar at the home of the page.</li>
<li>The text-area element in the contact section isn't complete. Placeholder is not showing and the height does not match the requirements.</li>
<li>Section and container structure prevents alternate backround colors to be implemented in a way that matches the design.</li>
<li>Image alignment issues on the our-services section.
<li>Typography clamp issues with the h2 tag, which is not scaling in smaller screens according to the design specs.</li>
<br>
<strong>More time would have allowed me to build solutions/fix these issues.</strong>

<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
<p>Some of the lessons that I learnt during this challenge:</p>
<li>Study the Figma/design file before starting to write code. It helps prepare for cleaner and easily editable code in advance.</li>
<li>Keep your code DRY. Do not Repeat Yourself. This is especially true when it comes to naming classes and assigning styles to them.</li>
